Beta Milestones & Offcial Milestones

## Milestone1

Beta Version

|  Number   | Deliverable  | link | Specification |
|  ----  | ----  | ---- | ---- |
| 0a.  | Factory Contract | N/A  | Ability to add new pairs and pool, and to interact with swap contract. |
| 0b.  | Swap Route Contrac | N/A  | Ability to correctly exchange interactions with all liquidity pool contracts. The trading algorithm is performed using the k=xy algorithm. |
| 0c.  | Pool Contract | N/A  | Ability to interact with contracts to properly perform Swap operations with Swap's route contracts. |
| 0d.  | LP Farm Contract | N/A  | The LP Token in possession of the user can be correctly deposited and executed by the mining pool to settle out the reward Token. |
| 0e.  | Front-end Module | N/A  | Ability to correctly execute all contract logic and support operations such as slippage setting and Token selection. |
| 0f.  | Token list Module | N/A  | Ability to load Token list modules correctly and support user-defined Token list addresses. |
| 0g.  | Subgraph Module | N/A  | Build Graph service that can support Dex transaction query on rangers chain. Ability to return event info based on specific filtering criteria. (May not be fully deployable if it is not a full EVM) |
| 1.  | info/charts Module | N/A  | Based on the transaction info returned by the Graph service, a series of chart information such as trade charts are rendered on the front-end.  (May not be fully deployable if it is not a full EVM) |
